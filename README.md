# Weather Prediction
A simple tool that I built to solve the weather prediction problem using Viterbi Algorithm for my machine learning course. I also implemented the same algorithm in Python, which can be found [here](https://github.com/hsuanhauliu/life-long-learning/tree/master/machine-learning/hidden-markov-model).
