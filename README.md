# Weather Prediction with Viterbi Algorithm
A simple tool that I built to solve the weather prediction problem. The entire algorithm used here Viterbi algorithm written in plain old javascript. Bootstrap was used to make a simple organized layout of the page. I have also implemented the same algorithm in Python, which can be found [here](https://github.com/hsuanhauliu/coding-practice/tree/master/machine-learning/viterbi-algorithm).
