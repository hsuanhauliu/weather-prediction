# Weather Prediction with Viterbi Algorithm
A simple tool that I built to solve the weather prediction problem for my machine learning course. The algorithm used here is the Viterbi algorithm written in javascript. Bootstrap was used to build this simple and organized layout of the page. I have also implemented the same algorithm in Python, which can be found [here](https://github.com/hsuanhauliu/coding-practice/tree/master/machine-learning/hidden-markov-model).
